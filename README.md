## Installation

1. fitbot is a NodeJS module. You'll need to install that first. More information can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
2. Next, check out the fitbot code. `git clone git@github.com:pifantastic/fitbot.git`
3. Install dependencies. `cd fitbot && npm install`
4. Run fitbot. I use a tool called `pm2`. You can find more information about it [here](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2).
  1. `npm install pm2 -g`
  2. `pm2 start index.js`

## Configuration

Start by copying the provided sample configuration:

```
cp config.sample.json config.json
```

Next, update the configuration for your purposes. Here are what the various options mean:

### `activity_check_interval` (Default: 60000)
This is how often fitbot will check Strava for new activity, measured in milliseconds. You probably don't want to use too small of a number, or else you'll run into Strava API rate limits.

### `strava_clubs` (Default: [])
This is an array of the Strava clubs in which to look for activities, and the corresponding
webhook needed to post them to Slack. Here is an example of the format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1234,
    "webhook": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX/XXXX/XXXX"
  }
]
```

`id` is the ID of the Strava club. This can be a bit challenging to figure out. A simple way to find it is to go to the webpage for the Strava club, and then click the `Club Leaderboard` link. You'll be taken to a new webapge whose URL contains the club's ID. For
example: `https://www.strava.com/clubs/123456`.

`webhook` is a Slack incoming webhook. You can find more information on how to set these up [here](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).

### `strava_token` (Default: "")
This is a Strava API token. You can get one of these by creating a new Strava API application. More information on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)

*NOTE*: The user who created the Strava API application needs to be a member of
all of the clubs configured in `strava_clubs` for fitbot to work!

### `slack_name` (Default: "fitbot")
This is the name fitbot will use when posting activites to Slack.

### `slack_icon` (Default: "http://i.imgur.com/2E6yJjV.png")
This is the icon that fitbot will use when posting activities to Slack.

## FAQ

## Changelog

### `1.1.0`

fitbot maintains a list of activities to prevent reposting activities it has already posted. Historically that list has been kept in
memory. This, however, means fitbit did not persist across restarts/crashes, causing it to occasionally bomb slack with lots of activities
that had already been posted. Version `1.1.0` uses a file-backed database to maintain the list of activities to avoid this.

### `1.0.0`

Initial release.
